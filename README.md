This is an export of the [Debian Tomcat Scripts](http://code.google.com/p/debian-tomcat-scripts/) hosted on Google Code

There are some enhancements to the original scripts
* updated the tomcat6 init script with the upstream version.  
* left the apache2 NamedVirtualHost directive up to apache at a higher level
